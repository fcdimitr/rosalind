ROSALIND builds individual, dependable data platforms for biomedical researchers and fosters decentralized, dynamic networks of data resources and data scientists, in co-existence with centralized data archives and services.

Our mission is to empower researchers with dependable, self-governed data platforms that 

 1. safeguard critical data properties (history, validity, integrity, privacy, security, utility, regulated accessibility, time-sensitive protection, and integrability), 
 2. promote creation, dissemination and ethical utilization of intellectual property and advanced techniques, and 
 3. foster sustainable networks of data resources and self-assembling research communities.

ROSALIND promises broad impacts. 

 * Sustainable, scalable and affordable data systems can be achieved by the co-existence of centralized and decentralized systems. 
 * Researches can thrive with critical support of diverse and innovative investigations, avoidance of premature standardization, prevention of misconduct, and facilitation of fair competition and collaboration. 
 * The heterogeneous dynamic networks of data and data scientists will enable new types of categorization or unification, leading to better understanding and new discoveries.
